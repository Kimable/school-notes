## üí∞ 4.2.1 Identify and Classify Costs

### üì¶ What are Costs?

Costs are the money a business spends to produce goods or services.

### üßæ Types of Costs

| Type of Cost       | Description                                   | Example                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Costs**    | Stay the same no matter how much is produced. | Rent, salaries, insurance       |
| **Variable Costs** | Change depending on how much is produced.     | Raw materials, packaging, wages |
| **Total Cost**     | All costs added together.                     | Fixed costs + Variable costs    |
| **Average Cost**   | Cost per unit produced.                       | Total cost √∑ Number of units    |

> **Example:**  
> If a factory pays $1,000 rent (fixed) and $2 per unit (variable), making 500 units:
>
> - Variable Cost = 500 √ó $2 = $1,000
> - Total Cost = $1,000 (fixed) + $1,000 (variable) = $2,000
> - Average Cost = $2,000 √∑ 500 = $4 per unit

### üìä Using Cost Data for Decisions

Businesses use cost data to make decisions like:

- **Should we continue or stop production?**
- **Can we reduce costs to increase profit?**
- **Is the price we charge enough to cover our costs?**

> **Example:** If costs are higher than sales revenue, the business may decide to stop production.

## üè¢ 4.2.2 Economies and Diseconomies of Scale

### üìâ Economies of Scale

When a business grows, its **average cost per unit falls** because it can operate more efficiently.

#### üí° Types of Economies of Scale:

| Type           | How it Saves Money                                    | Example                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Purchasing** | Bulk buying reduces cost per unit                     | Discounts for large orders |
| **Marketing**  | Spreading marketing costs over more units             | One advert = more sales    |
| **Financial**  | Easier to get cheaper loans                           | Banks trust bigger firms   |
| **Managerial** | Hiring specialised managers improves efficiency       | HR, finance experts        |
| **Technical**  | Using advanced machines to produce faster and cheaper | Automated production lines |

### üìà Diseconomies of Scale

When a business becomes **too large**, its **average cost per unit may increase** due to problems with management and communication.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Causes of Diseconomies:

| Problem                | Why it Increases Cost                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Poor Communication** | Too many departments = confusion and delays                 |
| **Lack of Commitment** | Workers feel unimportant in a big company                   |
| **Weak Coordination**  | Difficult to organise and control all parts of the business |

> **Conclusion:** Bigger is not always better! Businesses must grow carefully.

## üìà 4.2.3 Break-even Analysis

### üîç What is Break-even?

Break-even is the point where **total revenue = total costs**.  
At this point, the business **makes no profit and no loss**.

### üßÆ Break-even Formula:

:::tip Break-even Formula
Break-even output = Fixed Costs √∑ Contribution per unit

Contribution per unit = Selling Price ‚Äì Variable Cost per unit
:::

> **Example:**  
> Selling price = $10, Variable cost = $6, Fixed cost = $2,000  
> Contribution per unit = $10 - $6 = $4  
> Break-even = $2,000 √∑ $4 = **500 units**

### üìä Break-even Chart

A break-even chart shows:

- Total revenue line
- Total cost line
- Break-even point (where they meet)
- Output on the x-axis
- Costs/revenue on the y-axis

You should be able to:

- **Draw**, **complete**, or **amend** a break-even chart
- **Identify** the break-even point on the chart
- **Interpret** what the chart tells you about profit or loss

### üìè Margin of Safety

**Definition:**  
The amount by which actual sales exceed break-even sales.

:::tip Formula:
Margin of Safety = Actual Output ‚Äì Break-even Output
:::

> **Example:**  
> If a business produces 800 units and break-even is 500 units:  
> Margin of Safety = 800 - 500 = **300 units**

### üìå Using Break-even Analysis

Break-even helps with decisions like:

- Should we raise prices?
- Is it worth launching a new product?
- How much do we need to sell to avoid losses?

> **Example:** If price increases, break-even point may be reached sooner.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Break-even Analysis

- Assumes all units are sold (no waste or unsold stock)
- Assumes fixed and variable costs stay the same
- Doesn‚Äôt consider unexpected changes (e.g. inflation, strikes)
- Only useful for **short-term planning**
