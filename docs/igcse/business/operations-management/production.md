## 📦 4.1.1: The Meaning of Production

### 🔧 What is Production?

Production is the process of using **resources** (like raw materials, labour, and machines) to make **goods** (physical products like phones or shoes) or provide **services** (like teaching or haircuts).

### ⚙️ Managing Resources Effectively

A business must use its resources **wisely and efficiently** to:

- Reduce waste
- Lower costs
- Increase profits
- Satisfy customers

### 📊 Production vs Productivity

| Term             | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Production**   | The total number of goods/services made by a business. |
| **Productivity** | How much output each worker or machine can produce.    |

> **Example:**  
> A car factory makes 100 cars a day (production). If each worker makes 5 cars a day, that’s the productivity.

### ✅ Benefits of Increasing Efficiency

Efficiency means **producing more with fewer resources**.

**Why it's good:**

- Lower costs
- Higher profits
- Faster production
- Better quality

### 🔼 How to Increase Productivity

1. **Automation and Technology**

   - Use machines and robots to speed up work.
   - _Example: Computer-controlled machines in factories._

2. **Improved Labour Skills**
   - Train workers to be faster and better at their jobs.
   - _Example: Workers learning how to use new machines._

### 📦 Why Businesses Hold Inventories

**Inventory (or stock)** refers to:

- Raw materials
- Work-in-progress (unfinished goods)
- Finished goods

**Reasons to hold inventory:**

- Avoid running out of stock
- Continue production even if suppliers delay
- Meet unexpected customer demand

### 🧹 Lean Production

Lean production means **cutting out waste** while still producing quality goods.

#### 💡 How to Achieve Lean Production:

1. **Just-in-Time (JIT)**

   - Only order or make things **when needed**.
   - Saves storage costs.
   - _Risk: Production stops if stock doesn’t arrive on time._

2. **Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**
   - Workers give small, regular ideas to improve efficiency.
   - Builds teamwork and quality.

#### 🟢 Benefits of Lean Production:

- Less waste
- Lower costs
- Higher productivity
- Better quality

## 🏭 4.1.2: Main Methods of Production

### 🧵 1. Job Production

**One product made at a time**, usually custom-made.

**Advantages:**

- High quality
- Customised for customer
- Workers feel motivated

**Disadvantages:**

- Time-consuming
- Expensive
- Skilled labour needed

**Example:** Handmade furniture, wedding cakes

### 🍪 2. Batch Production

**Goods made in groups (batches)**, then switch to a new product.

**Advantages:**

- Lower cost than job production
- Can make variety
- Some automation possible

**Disadvantages:**

- Delay between batches
- Machines must be cleaned/reset
- Storage needed for batches

**Example:** Bread, clothes in different sizes

### 🚗 3. Flow Production (Mass Production)

**Continuous production** of the same product on an assembly line.

**Advantages:**

- Very efficient
- Low cost per item
- High output

**Disadvantages:**

- Expensive machines
- Less variety
- Workers may get bored

**Example:** Cars, phones, bottled drinks

### 🤔 Choosing a Method of Production

Businesses choose the method based on:

- Type of product
- Quantity needed
- Skill of workers
- Cost

> **Example:** A custom luxury car → Job production  
> A mobile phone factory → Flow production

## 💻 4.1.3: How Technology Is Changing Production

### 🖥️ Examples of Technology in Production:

1. **CAD (Computer-Aided Design)**

   - Use computers to design products
   - Faster and more accurate

2. **CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)**

   - Machines controlled by computers
   - Makes identical products with speed and precision

3. **Robotics and Automation**
   - Robots do repetitive tasks
   - Useful in flow production

### 🟢 Benefits of Technology in Production:

- Faster and more accurate
- Lower labour costs
- Better quality control
- Safer working conditions

### 🔴 Limitations:

- High cost to buy and maintain
- Workers may lose jobs
- Need for training
