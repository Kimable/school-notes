## **The Basic Economic Problem: Needs, Wants, Scarcity, and Opportunity Cost**

- **Needs** are essential goods or services for survival (e.g. food, water, shelter, clothing).

- **Wants** are unlimited and refer to non-essential desires (e.g. smartphones, designer clothes).

- The **economic problem** arises because **resources (factors of production)** are limited, while **wants are unlimited**. This leads to **scarcity** – not all wants and needs can be satisfied.

- Scarcity forces individuals, businesses, and governments to **make choices**, leading to **opportunity cost** – the next best alternative foregone when making a decision.

## **Factors of Production**

Factors of production are **resources** needed to produce goods or services

The four **factors of production** used to produce goods and services are:

- **Land** – natural resources (e.g. oil, minerals, farmland).

- **Labour** – human effort used in production.

- **Capital** – man-made resources used in production (e.g. machinery, tools).

- **Enterprise** – the risk-taking ability and organisation skills of entrepreneurs who combine the other three factors to produce goods/services.

## **Specialisation and Division of Labour**

**Specialisation** is when individuals, businesses, or economies focus on producing specific goods or services.

**Division of labour** is a form of specialisation where the production process is divided into separate tasks, each performed by different workers.

**Advantages:**

- Increases efficiency and productivity.

- Reduces production costs and training time.

- Allows workers to become skilled at specific tasks.

         **Disadvantages:**

- Work can become repetitive and boring.

  - Over-dependence on specific workers; if one is absent, production may stop.

  - Reduced flexibility in the workforce.

## **The Purpose of Business Activity**

- Businesses **combine scarce resources (factors of production)** to produce goods and services that satisfy people’s needs and wants.

- Business activity is essential for:

  - Solving the problem of scarcity by producing useful goods/services.

  - Providing employment and income.

  - Improving living standards by enabling trade and consumption.

- Without business activity, people would need to be self-sufficient, which limits efficiency and standard of living.

## **The Concept of Added Value**

- **Added value** is the difference between the **selling price** of a product and the **cost of the materials and components** used to make it.

      ***Added Value \= Selling Price – Cost of Inputs***

- It is **not the same as profit**, as added value must also cover other costs like wages, rent, and advertising.

**Why is added value important?**

- It allows businesses to cover their operational costs.

- It helps generate profit if costs are controlled.

- It improves competitiveness and business survival.

**Ways to increase added value:**

1. **Increase the selling price** without raising input costs, e.g., by:

   - Improving product quality.

   - Building a strong brand.

   - Enhancing packaging or customer service.

2. **Reduce the cost of materials** without reducing the price, e.g., by:

   - Sourcing cheaper inputs.

   - Improving operational efficiency.
