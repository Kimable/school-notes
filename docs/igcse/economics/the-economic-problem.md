## **üåç The Nature of the Economic Problem**

### **The Basic Economic Problem**

- **Unlimited wants** vs **limited resources** \= **scarcity**.

- Because of scarcity, **choices** must be made by:

  - **Individuals** (households)

  - **Firms** (private businesses)

  - **Governments**

Economics is the study of **how scarce resources are allocated** to meet unlimited wants and needs.

### **The 3 Basic Economic Questions**

All economies must answer:

1. **What to produce?**

2. **How to produce it?**

3. **For whom to produce it?**

These questions guide **resource allocation** decisions by economic agents.

### **üë• Economic Agents**

1. **Individuals/households** ‚Äì decide what to buy, where to work, etc.

2. **Firms** ‚Äì decide what to produce and how to produce.

3. **Government** ‚Äì decides how to use public resources, e.g., building schools, hospitals.

## **üì¶ Goods and Services**

- **Goods** \= Physical items (e.g., furniture, toothpaste, pencils).

- **Services** \= Non-physical activities (e.g., bus rides, education, concerts).

### **‚ù§Ô∏è Needs vs Wants**

| Needs                                                            | Wants                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Essential for survival (e.g., water, food, shelter, healthcare). | Not essential but desirable (e.g., video games, designer clothes). |
| Limited                                                          | Unlimited                                                          |

## **‚öñÔ∏è Types of Goods**

### **üí∞ Economic Goods**

- **Scarce** in supply.

- Human effort is needed to produce them.

- Examples: oil, wheat, cars.

### **üí® Free Goods**

- **Unlimited** in supply.

- No opportunity cost.

- Examples: air, rainwater, sunlight.

Be careful\! A **"free" government service** (like free healthcare) is **not** a free good‚Äîit still uses resources and has an **opportunity cost**.
