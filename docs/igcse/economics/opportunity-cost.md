### **ðŸ§  What is Opportunity Cost?**

**Opportunity cost** is the **next best alternative** that you give up when you make a choice.

Every time you choose something, you give up something else. That "something else" is your **opportunity cost**.

### **ðŸ“Œ Simple Definition:**

**Opportunity Cost \= What you give up when you choose something else.**

### **ðŸ“š Examples You Can Relate To:**

| Going to university                        | Salary you could have earned if you had worked instead |

### **ðŸ¤” Why Is Opportunity Cost Important?**

Opportunity cost is important because **resources (like money, time, and labour) are limited**, but our wants are unlimited. So we must **make choices**.

When we choose one thing, we lose the benefit of the next best alternative.

### **ðŸ’¡ Who Faces Opportunity Costs?**

#### **1\. Consumers (Buyers):**

- Have limited money.

- Must choose between products.

- Example: Buying a phone vs. buying a tablet.

#### **2\. Workers:**

- Choose one job/career over another.

- Example: Becoming a doctor means you canâ€™t be an engineer.

#### **3\. Producers (Businesses):**

- Decide how to use their resources.

- Example: Toyota choosing to invest in electric cars instead of petrol cars.

#### **4\. Governments:**

- Have limited budgets.

- Must decide between projects.

- Example: Spending more on roads means spending less on hospitals.

### **âœ… Key Point to Remember:**

**All choices involve an opportunity cost.** Wise decision-makers choose the option with the **greatest benefit** or **highest return**.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Quick Recap:**

- **Opportunity cost** \= **next best thing you give up**.

- Affects everyone: consumers, workers, producers, and governments.

- Helps in making **smart economic decisions**.
