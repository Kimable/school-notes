## **🔁 Mobility of Factors of Production**

**Mobility** \= how easily resources can be changed or moved.

More mobility \= better productivity and growth for a country\!

## **📈 Changes in Quantity and Quality of Resources**

Things that can affect the **availability and usefulness** of land, labour, capital, and enterprise:

- 💸 **Costs of production** – e.g., higher wages may reduce demand for labour.

- 🏛️ **Government policies** – taxes, subsidies, education, and healthcare investments.

- 🤖 **Technology** – improves productivity.

- 🌍 **Migration** – increases labour supply.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Better education/healthcare** – improves quality of labour.

- ☀️ **Weather conditions** – affects agricultural output.

## **📝 Quick Revision Tips**

- Always link **scarcity** to **choice** and **opportunity cost**.

- Use **real-life examples** in exams to show understanding.

- Remember the **factors of production** and their rewards—they often appear in MCQs and short-answer questions.
