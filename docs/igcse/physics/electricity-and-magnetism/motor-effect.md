### **ðŸ”¬ What Is the Motor Effect?**

When a **wire carrying an electric current** is placed in a **magnetic field**, it **experiences a force**.  
 If the wire is free to move, it **moves (or jumps)** due to this force.

### **ðŸ§ª Experiment: Demonstrating the Motor Effect**

#### **What You Need:**

- A **C-shaped magnet** (permanent or electromagnet)

- A **flexible wire** placed between the poles of the magnet

- A **power supply and switch**

#### **What Happens:**

1. The wire is loosely placed inside the magnetic field.

2. When the switch is closed, **current flows through the wire**.

3. The wire **jumps upwards** (or downwards, depending on directions).

4. If you:

   - Reverse the **current**, the wire moves in the **opposite direction**.

   - Reverse the **magnetic field**, the wire also moves in the **opposite direction**.

5. The **stronger** the current or magnetic field, the **bigger the force**.

### **ðŸ§² Why Does the Wire Move?**

- The **magnetic field from the magnet** interacts with the **magnetic field created by the current in the wire**.

- The result is a **combined magnetic field** with more field lines **on one side of the wire**.

- These lines act like **stretched rubber bands**, pulling the wire to **equalize the field**, which causes a **force**.

- The force is **strongest when the wire is at right angles** to the magnetic field.

### **âœ‹ Flemingâ€™s Left-Hand Rule**

Use this rule to figure out the direction of the force on the wire.

**Hold your left hand** like this:

- First finger \= direction of the **Magnetic Field** (Field)

- Second finger \= direction of the **Current**

- Thumb \= direction of the **Force** (Thrust)

ðŸ§  **TIP:** Remember **FBI**:

- **F** \= Magnetic Field (First finger)

- **B** \= Current (seCond finger)

- **I** \= Force/Thrust (Thumb)

ðŸ“Œ The force is **zero** if the wire is **parallel to the field**.

### **âš¡ Force on Charged Particles in a Magnetic Field**

#### **What if itâ€™s a beam of electrons or ions?**

- Charged particles moving in a magnetic field **also experience a force**.

- This force causes the particles to **curve or move in circles**.

- The direction of the force is again found using **Flemingâ€™s Left-Hand Rule**.

ðŸ§² In diagrams, a **magnetic field into the paper** is shown using **crosses (Ã—)**  
 (e.g., like the tail of an arrow going away from you).

#### **IMPORTANT:**

- For **electrons (negative charge)**: treat the current as going in the **opposite direction**.

- For **positive particles**: use the currentâ€™s **actual direction**.
