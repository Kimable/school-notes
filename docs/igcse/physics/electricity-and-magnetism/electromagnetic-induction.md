## **⚡ What is Electromagnetic Induction?**

**Electromagnetic induction** is the process of producing electricity using magnetism. It was discovered in 1831 by **Michael Faraday**. This discovery led to the invention of **generators**, which are used in power stations to produce electricity.

## **🔬 Key Experiments to Understand Electromagnetic Induction**

### **🧲 1\. Straight Wire and U-Shaped Magnet**

- A wire is placed between the poles of a U-shaped magnet.

- When the wire is moved **up or down**, the **galvanometer (meter)** shows a deflection → **a current is induced**.

- The current stops when the wire stops moving.

- **Direction of current depends on the direction of motion.**

✅ **Conclusion**: Moving a wire through a magnetic field **induces a current** in the wire.

### **🧲 2\. Bar Magnet and Coil**

- A magnet is pushed **into** a coil → current flows in one direction.

- Magnet is **held still** inside the coil → **no current**.

- Magnet is **pulled out** → current flows in the **opposite direction**.

- Same effect happens if the **coil is moved** instead of the magnet.

✅ **Conclusion**: An e.m.f. (electromotive force) is **induced** when there is **relative motion** between the magnet and coil.

## **📈 What Affects the Size of the Induced e.m.f.?**

Faraday found that the size of the induced e.m.f. depends on:

1. **Speed of motion** (faster \= bigger e.m.f.)

2. **Number of turns** in the coil (more turns \= bigger e.m.f.)

3. **Strength of the magnet** (stronger \= bigger e.m.f.)

🧠 **Key Idea**:

**The size of the induced e.m.f. is directly proportional to the rate at which magnetic field lines are cut.**

## **🔄 Direction of the Induced e.m.f. (Lenz’s Law)**

- The **induced current always opposes** the motion that causes it.  
   This follows the **Law of Conservation of Energy**.

### **Example:**

- Moving a north pole **into** a coil → the coil becomes a **north pole** to **oppose** the motion (like poles repel).

- Pulling the magnet **out** → the coil becomes a **south pole** to try to **pull the magnet back**.

✅ This **opposing effect** prevents energy from being created out of nothing.

## **👉 Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule (Dynamo Rule)**

This rule helps us find the **direction** of the induced current in a **moving wire**:

Thu**M**b → **M**otion of wire  
**F**irst finger → Magnetic **F**ield (N to S)  
Se**C**ond finger → Induced **C**urrent

✋ Remember:  
Use your **right hand** and hold your thumb and fingers **at right angles** to each other.

## **🔑 Key Definitions**

### **Electromagnetic induction:**

The process of generating an e.m.f. (and possibly a current) in a conductor due to a changing magnetic field or movement across it.

### **Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule:**

A rule used to find the direction of the induced current in a conductor moving at right angles to a magnetic field.
